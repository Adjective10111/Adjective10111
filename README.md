## Hi there 👋

I'm Mohammadmahdi. I'm a senior software developer; I've got my bachelor in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran
and continuing my education as a Computer-Architecture master student in this top university of Iran.

I'm a fast learner, because of my obsession to know and understand.
I try to always move forward and expand my knowledge and skills.

Due to my passionate learnings, I've learned many programming languages and frameworks😅.
And in doing so, I saw that these are just tools that have a slight advantage over eachother in their designated field,
and jumping from one to the other is no big deal.

## My Skills 🤹‍♂️

As I've said, I love to learn, therefore, I have a _long_ learning list :)
which I'll update when I learn more🙃.

###### and I also need to review some to remember the syntax and such😁

- C/C++
- PHP
  - Laravel
- Typescript/Javascript
  - Express.js
  - React - __in learning list__
  <!-- - Electron - __in learning list__
  - Nest.js - __learning__
  - React.native - __in learning list__ -->
- Java
  - JavaFX
  - Spring - _need review_
- Python
  - OpenCV - _a bit_
- Kotlin - __in learning list__
- C#
  - .Net - __in learning list__

But to name the tools that I'm _currently_ using:

- Full-time Job:
  - C++
  - Java
- Freelancing Project:
  - Laravel
  - Express.js

## Hobby 🕹️

As for my hubbies, other than learning, I play games and watch movies.

I'm really into video games, _team PLAYSTATION_, and super hero movies, _team MARVEL_.
I'd never say no to a good one, though.😉
