## Hi there 👋

I'm Mohammadmahdi. I'm a junior computer engineer; I've got my bachelor in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran.

I'm a fast learner, because I love to know and understand.
I try to always move forward and expand my knowledge and skills.

Due to my passionate learnings, I've learned many programming languages😅.

## My Skills 🤹‍♂️

As I said, I love to learn so I have a _long_ learning list :)
which I'll add to the list when I learn more🙃.

###### and I also need to review some to remember the syntax and such😁

- Typescript
  - Express.js
  - Nest.js - __learning__
  - React - __in learning list__
  <!-- - Electron - __in learning list__
  - React.native - __in learning list__ -->
- PHP
  - Laravel
- Java
  - JavaFX
  - Spring - _need review_
- Kotlin - __in learning list__
- C#
  - .Net - _abandoned_
- Python
  - OpenCV - _a bit_
- C/C++

But to name the frameworks that I'm _currently_ working with:

- Express.js

## Hubby 🕹️

As for my hubbies, other than learning, I play games and watch movies.

I'm really into video games, _team PLAYSTATION_, and super hero movies, _team MARVEL_.
I'd never say no to a good one, though.😉
